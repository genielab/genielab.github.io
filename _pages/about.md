Genie is the name of my beagle dog and hence the name of this blog too. The primary motivation for writing this blog comes from the interest I developed
in data analysis and exploration and machine learning. Most of the posts in this blog are simple case study analysis and some 
data backed stories on broad range of topics. Occasionally I may write some posts like introductory primers
on some tool or technology especially when I want to write down something that I learned.  

Genie Lab (the blog) was done entirely using open source software. This site is powered by the Ruby gem [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and uses template from the amazing [Minimal Mistakes](https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/).  This site is hosted through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). This site uses fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). 
All images on this site are either royalty-free or are attributed to their owners.

If you are one of those who read top to bottom about software license agreements and privacy policies 
or have specific concerns about privacy on this site, please read [Genie Lab's Privacy Terms](/privacy/) or if you do not care, lets start our data journey right here.

Thank you, <br/>
