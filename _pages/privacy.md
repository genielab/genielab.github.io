### A Note on Privacy

**Analytics**

Genie Lab (the blog) uses certain third-party service providers such as Google Analytics to monitor and analyze the use of our Service. 
Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website traffic. Google uses the data collected to track and monitor the use of our Service. This data is shared with other Google services. 
Google may use the collected data to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network.
You can opt-out of having made your activity on the Service available to Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. 
The add-on prevents the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, and dc.js) from sharing information with Google Analytics about visits activity. For more information on the privacy practices of Google, please visit the Google Privacy & Terms web page: https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en                                                                                                                 
                
**Comments**

Every blog post on this site has an option for you to write comments, thoughts or opinions should you have any. 
For enabling comments, this site uses a third party service called Disqus. Disqus is a networked community platform used by hundreds of thousands of sites all over the web. Disqus provides feature-rich comment system complete with social network integration, advanced administration and moderation options, and other extensive community functions.                
                            
**Links to External Websites**

Genie Lab (the blog) occasionally may reference some links to certain external websites which are not maintained by me.
If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. 
We would strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit. 
We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.

**Interpreting Case Studies**

Genie Lab (the blog) may occasionally contain some blog posts involving case study analysis on certain worldly topics.
As much as I strive to provide validated information and insights with data backed stories and research, however it is 
not recommended for you to completely base your decisions on insights presented here.
